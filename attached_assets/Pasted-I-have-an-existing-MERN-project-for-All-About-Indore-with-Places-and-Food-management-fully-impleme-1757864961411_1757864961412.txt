I have an existing MERN project for “All About Indore” with Places and Food management fully implemented (backend + admin frontend). Now continue implementing the remaining sections and dynamic functionality as follows:

🗓 Events Management

Manage events data on server

CRUD for cultural events, festivals, and activities.

Include date fields, location, description, and category.

Validation and pagination similar to Places/Food.

Manage events on admin page

Admin table with search, filter, sorting, and pagination.

Form for adding/editing events with date picker.

Optimistic updates and proper error handling.

🖼 Gallery Management

Manage gallery images on server

CRUD operations for images with title, description, category.

Manage gallery on admin page

Table + form interface similar to Places/Food.

Image upload with preview.

📩 Contact Management

Manage contact messages on server

Store user messages with name, email, subject, message.

Manage contacts and replies

Admin interface to view, search, filter, and respond to messages.

⚙️ Site Configuration & Settings

Create site configuration settings

Admin can update News API key, Weather API key, site info.

🌤 Weather & News

Get local weather data

Fetch live weather for Indore from OpenWeatherMap API.

Get local news with filters

Fetch live news for Indore from NewsAPI or RSS feeds.

🌐 Client-Side Integration

Update client pages with data

Replace static content for Events, Gallery, Contact, Weather, and News with MongoDB-driven content.

Keep existing designs and layouts unchanged.

📸 Admin UX Enhancements

Upload and preview images

For Gallery, Places, Food, and Events.

Add search and filters to tables

For all admin tables (Events, Gallery, Contacts, etc.).

🗄 Data & Documentation

Create starting data for system

Populate MongoDB collections with sample data for Events, Gallery, Contact, Settings.

Write project setup guide (README.md)

Include project overview, tech stack, folder structure, setup instructions, admin login, API keys, dark/light mode, and how to run the project locally.

⚡ Notes for Replit AI

Keep client-side design exactly as is, only make content dynamic.

Admin panel must be modular, responsive, and support dark/light mode.

Protect all admin routes with authentication.

Use environment variables for JWT secret and API keys.

Implement proper validation, pagination, filtering, and optimistic updates for all tables.

Ensure mobile responsiveness and consistent UX with existing sections.
